# Session Narrative

## Current Session (2025-12-04) - Module Reward System & Character Sheet Redesign

### 🎮 NEW FEATURE: Ship Objective Module Rewards (Hades-style Boon System)

**Overview:**
Each ship (level) comes with an objective. Upon completion, the player receives a **module** - major game-shifting powers that aren't class-specific. This creates unique playthroughs similar to Hades' boon system.

**Module Reward System:**
- **Objective Types:**
  - Simple: "Kill all enemies"
  - Retrieval: "Retrieve item X"
  - Rescue: "Rescue person Y"
  - Other quest variants

- **Module Selection (Hades-style):**
  - Each ship has a **Major Faction** and **Minor Faction**
  - Upon objective completion, player chooses **1 of 3 modules**:
    - 2 options from Major Faction module pool
    - 1 option from Minor Faction module pool
  - Random selection from faction's pool, but player has choice

- **Ship Selection Preview:**
  - Before entering a ship, player sees:
    - Ship objective preview
    - Major/Minor faction indicators
    - Example modules from those factions (not exact rewards, but representative)
  - Allows strategic routing: "I want Imperial modules, so I'll take ship 2R instead of 2L"

**Module Design Principles:**
- Must be useful to ANY class (at least somewhat)
- Major game-shifting powers
- Create unique playsthroughs through combinations

**Example Major Modules:**
- **Fly** - Enables flight/hover movement
- **Dual Wielding** - Use two weapons simultaneously
- **Pistol Expertise** - Massive pistol damage/handling boost
- **Faction Diplomat** - +10 Charisma vs specific faction (e.g., Imperials)
- **Enhanced Jump** - Double/triple jump height
- **Speed Demon** - Significantly increased movement speed
- **Shield Generator** - Energy-based shield that absorbs damage
- **Ricochet Shots** - Bullets bounce to additional targets
- **Cloaking Device** - Temporary invisibility
- **Weapon Mastery (Type)** - Expertise with rifles/sabers/launchers/melee

**Implementation Tasks:**
1. Design 8-10 modules per faction (8 factions = 64-80 total modules)
2. Create module preview UI for ship selection screen
3. Implement objective tracking per ship
4. Build module selection screen (post-objective completion)
5. Apply module effects to player stats/abilities
6. Persist modules across level transitions
7. Display active modules in character sheet

**Faction Module Themes:**
- **Rebels:** Resourcefulness, adaptability, underdog bonuses
- **Imperials:** Discipline, organization, overwhelming force
- **Clones:** Teamwork, precision, battlefield tactics
- **Mandalorians:** Combat mastery, honor, weapon expertise
- **Sith:** Dark powers, aggression, fear-based abilities
- **Aliens:** Diversity, unique biology, exotic tech
- **Droids:** Logic, efficiency, technical superiority
- **Takers:** Scavenging, survival, improvisation

## Previous Session (2025-12-02) - Simplified Stat Progression System

### ✅ COMPLETED: Simplified D20 SRD Stat Progression

**Complete stat system overhaul** to make progression easier to understand and more predictable:

**New System Design:**
- ✅ **Strong base stats at creation** - Each class starts with stats appropriate to their playstyle
- ✅ **+2 to primary stat every 5th level** - Clean, predictable progression at levels 5, 10, 15, 20
- ✅ **Other stats mostly static** - Small thematic growth only (CON for survivability, DEX for combat classes)
- ✅ **No complex rotation** - Replaced old every-level stat rotation with simple milestone system

**All Four Base Classes Updated:**

1. **Hunter Killer (STR Primary)** - 3 Skills
   - Starting: STR 16, DEX 12, CON 14, INT 10, WIS 10, CHA 8
   - STR progression: 18 (L5), 20 (L10), 22 (L15), 24 (L20)
   - Minor: DEX +3, CON +3 over 20 levels
   - Skills: **Intimidate** (cause fear/flee), **Jump** (+0.05 height/level), **Repair** (heal droids/self like Medicine)

2. **Protocol Droid (CHA Primary)** - 7 Skills
   - Starting: STR 8, DEX 10, CON 9, INT 12, WIS 13, CHA 16
   - CHA progression: 18 (L5), 20 (L10), 22 (L15), 24 (L20)
   - Minor: DEX +3, CON +3, INT +3, WIS +3 over 20 levels
   - Skills: **Jump** (+0.02 height/level), **Diplomacy** (talk to non-hostiles), **Gather Info** (see distant ships/docks), **Medicine** (heal 5%/level at new level), **Repair** (heal droids/self), **Slicing** (d20 roll), **Speak Languages** (automatic at L1)

3. **Slicer/Techie (INT Primary)** - 7 Skills
   - Starting: STR 8, DEX 13, CON 10, INT 16, WIS 12, CHA 8
   - INT progression: 18 (L5), 20 (L10), 22 (L15), 24 (L20)
   - Minor: DEX +5, CON +3, WIS +3 over 20 levels
   - Skills: **Craft** (+1 weapon damage chance), **Jump** (+0.01 height/level), **Medicine** (d20 roll heal), **Repair** (heal droids/self), **Scavenge** (+Wire at new level), **Slicing** (d20 roll), **Speak Language** (+1/level)

4. **Adept (WIS Primary)** - 4 Skills (Cannot speak to droids!)
   - Starting: STR 12, DEX 12, CON 12, INT 10, WIS 16, CHA 12
   - WIS progression: 18 (L5), 20 (L10), 22 (L15), 24 (L20)
   - Minor: STR +6, DEX +5, CON +3, INT +2, CHA +3 over 20 levels (most balanced)

**Key Benefits:**
- 📊 **Much easier to understand** - Players see their primary stat grow predictably
- 🎯 **Clear class identity** - Base stats immediately show class strengths/weaknesses
- 🧮 **Less bookkeeping** - No rotating stat bonuses to track every level
- ⚖️ **Maintained balance** - All classes reach similar power levels by L20

**Files Modified:**

- **Commando**: Demolitions, Tactics, Leadership, Weapon Focus, Unarmed Combat, Survival

### 📋 PLANNED: HP & Damage System Overhaul

**New HP Formula:**
- **Starting HP = (5 × CON) + (1 × class HP per level)**
- **Example (HK with CON 14, 12 HP/level)**: `(5 × 14) + 12 = 82 HP` at level 1
- **Example (Protocol with CON 9, 6 HP/level)**: `(5 × 9) + 6 = 51 HP` at level 1
- **Level-up HP gain**: Class HP per level value (HK +12, Slicer +6, Protocol +6, Adept +7)
- **CON bonus applies retroactively** - If CON increases, recalculate full HP

**Current HP values** (from `class_progression_tables.json`):
- Hunter Killer: 18 base + 8/level → **Will become**: CON-based + 12/level
- Slicer: 14 base + 6/level → **Will become**: CON-based + 6/level
- Protocol Droid: 12 base + 5/level → **Will become**: CON-based + 6/level
- Adept: 16 base + 7/level → **Will become**: CON-based + 7/level

**New Damage System:**
- **Weapon damage range**: 2d4 to 3d8 (minimum 2, maximum 24 damage)
- **Current system**: Weapons deal 1-3 base damage (too low)
- **Dice progression examples**:
  - Weak pistols: 2d4 (2-8 damage)
  - Standard rifles: 2d6 (2-12 damage)
  - Heavy blasters: 2d8 (2-16 damage)
  - Sniper rifles: 3d6 (3-18 damage)
  - Rocket launchers: 3d8 (3-24 damage)

**Implementation Status:**
- ⏳ HP formula needs update in `character_stats_manager.js`
- ⏳ Damage dice system needs implementation in `player_gear.js` and weapon configs
- ⏳ Weapon JSON files need damage dice notation (e.g., `"damage_dice": "2d6"`)
- ⏳ NPC weapons need dice damage too

### 🎨 Character Sheet Layout Redesign (Previous Session Continuation)

From the previous session's work, the character sheet UI was completely redesigned:

**Layout Changes:**
- ✅ **Ultra-narrow left panel (180px)** - Compact class/level/stat display with small fonts (9-14px)
- ✅ **Massive progression table** - Takes ~90% of screen width with large fonts (15-20px)
- ✅ **Removed "Gonk Pope Status" box** - No longer needed
- ✅ **Resource counter relocated** - Blue-outlined box in bottom-right corner (Wire, Spare Cores, Credits)
- ✅ **Level Up button moved** - From character sheet (C) to cheats menu (P)
- ✅ **F9 fullscreen toggle** - Enter/exit fullscreen mode

**Grid Layout:**
- Changed from `250px 1fr` to `180px 1fr` (narrower left panel)
- Removed gap and padding for maximum table space
- Sticky table headers while scrolling
- Color-coded stats (STR, DEX, CON, etc. in yellow)

**Files Modified:**
- ✅ `main.js` - Fixed toggleCharacterSheet, added F9 fullscreen, credits state, level-up button handler
- ✅ `index.html` - Changed grid layout, removed Gonk Pope Status, added resource box, added level-up to cheats
- ✅ `data/ClassesAndSkills/character_upgrades.js` - Ultra-compact left panel, massive table design

## Previous Session (2025-12-01) - D20 SRD Class System + File Organization

### 📁 File Path Updates (Game Stays Playable)

Fixed all references to moved ClassesAndSkills files to ensure game continues working:
- ✅ **index.html**: Updated script paths for `character_upgrades.js`, `Gonkjedi_and_saber_effects.js`, `NPCjedi_and_saber_effects.js`
- ✅ **asset_loaders.js**: Updated `gonk_base_stats.json` path to `data/ClassesAndSkills/`
- ✅ **Renamed files**: `recovered_memories_*.json` → `permanent_nodes_*.json` (5 files)
  - **Classes** = current progress (levels, powers gained this run)
  - **Permanent nodes** = unlocked history (wire-purchased memories that persist through death)

### 🎮 Four-Class System (20 Levels Each)

Designed complete D20 SRD-based class progression for Gonk.

**📄 Full Documentation**:
- **`data/ClassesAndSkills/character_stats_system.md`** - Core stat system, HP formula, damage calculation, starting stats
- **`data/ClassesAndSkills/class_comparison.md`** - Complete class breakdown, skill point totals, design philosophy
- **`data/ClassesAndSkills/level_progression_visual.md`** - Visual level-by-level table for all 4 classes, multiclass examples
- **`data/ClassesAndSkills/implementation_order.md`** - Implementation difficulty analysis, phase planning
- **`data/ClassesAndSkills/gonk_class_*.json`** - Individual class JSON files (Protocol, HK, Tech, Adept)

**Quick Summary**:
- **Protocol** (CHA/WIS): Recruiter, 2 skills/lvl, early 2nd ally at L3, max 12 allies at L40
- **HK** (DEX/STR): Solo killer, 1 skill/lvl, progressive damage scaling, max 2 allies
- **Tech** (INT/DEX): Hacker, 3 skills/lvl, droid control (1→unlimited), stackable weapon mods
- **Adept** (WIS/CHA): Force user, 2 skills/lvl + 5 FP/lvl, Light/Dark choice at L15

**Key Mechanics**: No AC (FPS aim-based), multiclassing, wire currency, permanent "Recovered Memory" nodes, roguelike death (levels reset, nodes persist)

### ✅ HK CLASS IMPLEMENTED & PLAYABLE

**Core D20 System Live** (see `character_stats_system.md`):
- **Low damage/HP economy**: Weapons deal 1-3 base damage, HP ranges 10-30
- **HP = CON + levels**: Base HP equals CON stat (10 default) + class HP per level
- **Gonk blank slate**: All stats start at 10, class selection applies stat mods
- **Primary stat choice**: HK chooses STR (melee) or DEX (ranged), gets +4 to chosen stat
- **Flat damage bonuses**: +1, +2, +3 damage (not percentages)
- **Stat damage bonus**: STR for melee, DEX for ranged (formula: `floor((stat-10)/2)`)

**HK Starting Stats (DEX build)**: `DEX 14, CON 12, WIS 8, CHA 8` → **20 HP** (12 CON + 8 HK)

### 🎯 Implementation Status

**✅ COMPLETED:**
- ✅ Ability score system (STR/DEX/CON/INT/WIS/CHA)
- ✅ HP = CON + class levels formula
- ✅ Class selection UI (all 4 classes shown, HK playable)
- ✅ HK primary stat choice (STR melee vs DEX ranged)
- ✅ Starting stat modifiers (+4 primary, +2 CON, -2 WIS/CHA)
- ✅ Level-up system with power application
- ✅ HK Powers L1-10 implemented (Hunter Killer, Weapon Mastery, Burst Fire, etc.)
- ✅ C screen redesigned: Level display on left, powers on right
- ✅ Debug buttons: Level Up, Heal
- ✅ **STAT SYSTEM SIMPLIFIED**: +2 to primary stat every 5th level (levels 5, 10, 15, 20)

---
