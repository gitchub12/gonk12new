Character upgrades is too big and all one file.  So!  Change it.  EVERY module should have an origin, a rarity on a scale of 1-12, and its own icon and abilities.

Move those each into their specific folders.
The names below are in the NOW text.  The examples form L1 (lowest level) to L5 a high level but not the cap is an example of how these will work.  My original thought was to cap at 5 so you might see “fire resistant” at L1 and immune at L5, but spread it out and in that instance curve it or something so that it is never full immunity.
