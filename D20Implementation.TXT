D20 System Design Specification (The Ruleset)
This document defines the intended mechanics for the D20 system rebuild. Use this as the blueprint for implementation.

1. Core Mechanics
All mechanics rely on Attributes (Stats) and Skills.

The Modifier Formula
For all Attributes:

Modifier = Math.floor((Score - 10) / 2)

Score 10 = +0
Score 12 = +1
Score 18 = +4
Score 8 = -1
The Skill Check Formula
When performing an action (Slicing, Jumping, Persuading):

d20 Roll + Attribute Modifier + Proficiency Bonus (if trained) + Item Bonuses

2. Attributes & Effects
Each Attribute governs specific game mechanics.

STRENGTH (STR)
Melee Damage: Add STR Modifier to all melee weapon damage.
Carry Capacity: Determines inventory slots (Base 10 + STR Modifier).
Skills: Jump, Climb.
DEXTERITY (DEX)
Ranged Attack Speed: Reduces weapon cooldown/delay.
Rule: Cooldown = BaseCooldown * (1.0 - (DEX Modifier * 0.03))
Effect: +5 DEX Modifier = 15% faster firing.
Defense: (Future) Adds to Armor Class / Evasion.
Skills: Stealth, Acrobatics.
CONSTITUTION (CON)
Hit Points (HP): Adds to HP every level.
Rule: MaxHP = (ClassBaseHP + CON Modifier) * Level
Stamina: Determines sprint duration (Running).
Skills: Running.
Saves: Fortitude (Resist Poison/Stun).
INTELLIGENCE (INT)
Tech Skill: Primary stat for Slicing and Repair.
Skills: Slicing, Repair, Crafting.
Energy Regen: Increases Energy regeneration rate.
Rule: RegenRate = Base * (1.0 + (INT Modifier * 0.05))
WISDOM (WIS)
Perception: Ability to spot enemies/traps.
Skills: Perception, Insight, Medicine, Scavenge.
Saves: Will (Resist Mind Tricks/Fear).
CHARISMA (CHA)
Social: Influencing NPCs and prices.
Skills: Persuasion, Deception, Intimidate.
Shop Prices: Reduces shop costs by 2% * CHA Modifier.
3. Class Definitions
Classes define the Base Stats, Progression, and Proficiencies.

Hunter Killer (HK)
Archetype: Assassin / Sniper.
Primary Attribute: DEX.
Hit Die: d8 (8 HP + CON per level).
Proficiencies: Intimidate, Stealth.
Special: Starts with Ammo (Pamphlets).
Bonk
Archetype: Melee Brute.
Primary Attribute: STR.
Hit Die: d12 (12 HP + CON per level).
Proficiencies: Intimidate, Jump, Climb.
Slicer
Archetype: Hacker / Infiltrator.
Primary Attribute: INT.
Hit Die: d6 (6 HP + CON per level).
Proficiencies: Slicing, Deception, Stealth.
Special: Double proficiency bonus to Slicing.
Techie
Archetype: Engineer / Crafter.
Primary Attribute: INT.
Hit Die: d8 (8 HP + CON per level).
Proficiencies: Repair, Crafting.
4. Derived Stats
These values are calculated automatically from the Core Attributes.

Derived Stat	Formula	Updated When...
Melee Damage	WeaponDamage + STR Mod	Equipment Change / Level Up
Ranged Speed	WeaponBaseDelay * (1 - DEX Mod * 0.03)	Equipment Change / Level Up
Max HP	
(ClassBase + CON Mod) * Level
Level Up
Movement Speed	BaseSpeed + (CON or DEX Mod * 0.01)	Level Up / Sprinting
5. Implementation Requirements (For Rebuild)
To build this correctly:

Centralize Logic: Create a single D20Rules.js (or similar) that contains pure functions for these formulas. Do NOT scatter math in UI code.
State Source: 
CharacterStatsManager
 should hold the Scores (10, 12, 18). It should call D20Rules to get the Modifiers (+0, +1, +4).
No "Magic Numbers": All constants (like the 0.03 speed multiplier) should be defined at the top of the Rules file.
